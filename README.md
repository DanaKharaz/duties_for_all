# duties_for_all
This is an Android application. It was fully created by myself and served as a great learning experience to get started with Android development.

BACKGROUND

All students at a certain school are required to give back to the community they live in by working with animals or at the village's dining hall, etc. This is organized by the school’s boarding staff: they put together ‘duty lists’ taking into account which people are going to be on campus, everyone who has restrictions about certain types of duties (e.g. some students are exempt from animal duties), whoever may need extra duties (they may be given as punishment for breaking the school rules; it is not counted - as if the student(s) did not appear on the list), and most importantly, how to make it fair for all students.

PURPOSE

The purpose of the application is to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use method of creating a fair duty list system. The application will allow the school staff to create duty lists and maintain the whole system from their pocket, making it straightforward, efficient, and exact, reducing possible human errors.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

The application was developed with the following success criteria in mind, all of which were at least partially satisfied in the end:
- Minimally, the application should
    - Allow the user to create duty lists, taking into account all student restrictions, and who will be available at the given time
    - Be synchronized across all devices the application is installed on
    - Have a counting system to ensure that by the end of the year all students appeared on the list a more-or-less similar number of times (with different types of lists counted differently) and the students do not appear on many consecutive lists
    - Have a verification system to ensure only authorized users have access
    - Have an information section available at all times to provide guidance in the use of the application
- Typically, the application should
    - Allow the user to edit existing lists
    - Add some customization options in the list creation, such as which grades or groups should be included, or adding extra duties to certain students that will not be counted
    - Ensure the students’ privacy by not sharing any student restrictions, which students were added as ‘extra’, how many times the students appeared on the lists, etc.
    - Provide the option to create list templates to further optimize the list creation process
    - Prevent the user from moving on without answering all required questions or completing all required fields
    - Allow the user to freely go back without it causing any issues
- In the best-case scenario, the application should
    - Allow the user to edit all student data from within the application
    - Allow the user to both automatically and manually sort the lists, taking into account whether there are enough people available to be placed in the list just once and making sure no student appears multiple times in the same block
    - Allow the user to change list parameters (number of blocks and people in blocks) when editing an existing list
    - Have an additional feature allowing the school to keep track of which students are on campus and which are ‘checked in’ on certain days from within the same application
